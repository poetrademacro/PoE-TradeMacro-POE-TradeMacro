Welcome to POE-TradeMacro!

PoE TradeMacro is an Autohotkey (AHK) script that provides several convenient QoL features for Path of Exile Trading.

This builds on top of PoE-ItemInfo which provides very useful item information on ctrl+c. With TradeMacro, price checking is added via ctrl+d, ctrl+alt+d or ctrl+i. You can also open the items wiki page via ctrl+w or open the item search on poe.trade instead via ctrl+q.
TradeMacro will be updated to always have the latest PoE-ItemInfo code, you don't have to run their script since it's included here.

Warning

Never completely trust any price checking tool. Inform yourself about what this tool can do and what not (FAQ for example). Use the tools average and median prices to quickly judge if the first results could be accurate or totally wrong. When in doubt ask other people or do some manual checks.

Usage / Instructions

Install AHK (http://ahkscript.org). Don't install AutoHotkey v2.x.
Download the latest release and extract the zip-file.
Make sure to run PoE in (borderless) windowed mode. Otherwise it won't work!
Run Run_TradeMacro.ahk.
Default league is set to tmpstandard (Softcore Temp-League).
A lot of options, including the league can be changed by opening the settings window or editing config_trade.ini.
Make sure to play Path of Exile in english, if you're using a different language it probably won't work.
Right-click the script icon in your system tray and select PoE Item Info Settings to open the settings window and to edit both PoE-ItemInfos and PoE-TradeMacros settings.
